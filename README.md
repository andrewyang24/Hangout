# FriendshipApp

Remember the last time you ran into an old friend and both of you agreed to "hang out sometime"? How many times have you guys actually followed through with the plans or even contacted each other afterwards?

Friendship App pushes you to be a good friend and holds you accountable for your plans to meet up. Add a friend's profile and you'll get notifications reminding you to meet up with them every day. 'Today' indicates you are free, 'Tomorrow?' indicates you are busy, and 'Never' to flake on them forever.

This mobile app was built with React Native for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Frontend
Run using the Expo Go app. <br>
cd frontend <br>
